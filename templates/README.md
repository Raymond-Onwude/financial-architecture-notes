# Templates

This directory contains the canonical templates used across the Financial Architecture Notes repository.

These templates exist to:
- keep writing structured and consistent
- reduce cognitive load when publishing new notes
- ensure each entry is clear, auditable, and reusable

## Daily Note Template
Used for short, high-signal architecture notes published regularly.

- Purpose: capture a single idea clearly
- Scope: 200–600 words
- Location: relevant section folder (e.g. principles, ledger-design)

See: `daily-note-template.md`

## Case Study Template
Used for deeper, anonymized delivery patterns based on real-world work.

- Purpose: translate architecture thinking into outcomes
- Scope: longer-form, reflective
- Location: `notes/07-case-studies/`

See: `case-study-template.md`

Templates are intentionally minimal.
Examples live in their respective sections.
