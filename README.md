# Financial Architecture Notes
**By Raymond Onwude — Founder, DPIO**

Design finance so truth is routine & not a quarterly project.

This repository is a living notebook on building **decision-ready financial systems**: ledger design, controls, reporting intelligence, and ERP architecture.

It is written for **business owners, operators, CFOs, and implementation teams** who want clarity, governance, and speed; without fragile spreadsheets or disconnected tools.

## Why this exists
Most organizations don’t have a finance problem; they have an **architecture problem**:
- charts of accounts that can’t answer management questions
- workflows that weaken internal controls
- reporting that is late, inconsistent, or impossible to audit
- “ERP implementations” that ship features but not clarity

This repository focuses on **architecture-level thinking**: structures that hold up under growth, audits, multiple programs, and real-world operational complexity.

## What you’ll find here
- **Principles** for financial clarity and governance
- **Ledger design** patterns (COA strategy, dimensions, segments, subledgers)
- **Controls** (approval chains, segregation of duties, audit trails)
- **Reporting intelligence** (management reporting, funding reporting, KPIs)
- **ERP architecture** (Odoo and beyond) with practical deployment thinking
- **Automation** notes: validations, pipelines, and repeatable finance operations
- **Case studies** based on real delivery realities (anonymized patterns)
- **Opportunity intelligence**: scholarships, grants, awards, and programs relevant to finance and technology growth

---

## How I write
Short, structured notes. Each entry aims to be:
- **Actionable** — you can apply it to a real finance system
- **Auditable** — assumptions are explicit and logic is traceable
- **Scalable** — patterns that work as organizations grow
