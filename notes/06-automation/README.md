# Automation

Automation is the discipline of making finance repeatable. It should reduce manual work **without** weakening controls.

This section covers:
- Validations that catch issues before month-end
- Reconciliation automation (bank, AR/AP, payroll, clearing accounts)
- Data pipelines to dashboards
- Controls-as-code thinking

## Outcomes
- Faster close, fewer surprises
- Lower operational load on finance
- Better confidence in numbers

## Key topics
- Automated checks: completeness, duplicates, outliers, missing dimensions
- Reconciliation scripts: predictable monthly routines
- Operational-to-financial mapping: drivers feed forecasts
- Documentation that keeps automation maintainable
