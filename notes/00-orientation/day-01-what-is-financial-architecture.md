# Day 01 — What is Financial Architecture?
Financial Architecture is the **design of finance structures that produce trustworthy decisions**.

It sits above bookkeeping and above “ERP setup.” It answers:
- *Can leadership see reality — fast — with confidence?*
- *Can the organization scale without losing control?*
- *Can reporting withstand funders, audits, and operational complexity?*

## The core components
1) **Ledger Structure**
   - Chart of Accounts that reflects the business, not the software
   - Dimensions/segments that match how the organization is managed (program, location, funder, project, class)

2) **Control Design**
   - approvals, thresholds, segregation of duties
   - audit trails that make sense without heroic explanations

3) **Reporting Intelligence**
   - management views (profitability, cash, utilization, funding)
   - operational metrics tied to finance (FTE, service units, delivery outputs)

4) **System Architecture**
   - ERP configuration + integrations + data rules
   - deployment choices that minimize fragility and maximize governance

## A simple definition
If accounting is the record of truth, then financial architecture is the **system that keeps truth consistent** as the organization grows.

## What this repo will do
- publish practical design patterns
- translate “finance needs” into system-ready structures
- show how to think like a Financial Engineer — not just a tool user
