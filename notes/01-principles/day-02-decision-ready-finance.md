# Day 02 — Decision-Ready Finance
Decision-ready finance means leaders can answer three questions quickly and confidently:
1) Where are we now?
2) What changed?
3) What do we do next?

## The test
If your monthly close is “done” but management still debates the numbers, the issue is architecture:
- inconsistent coding rules
- unclear dimensions
- no reconciled operational drivers

## The objective
Design finance so truth is routine — not a quarterly project.
