# Case Studies

Case studies translate principles into real delivery.

These are anonymized patterns based on practical implementation realities:
- What was broken
- What we changed
- What the new architecture enabled
- What we would do differently

## Outcomes
- Executives understand ROI in plain language
- Teams see how architecture reduces complexity over time
- Readers can apply patterns to their own system

## Format
Each case study follows the repository template:
- Context
- Problem framing
- Architecture decisions
- Implementation notes
- Measurable outcomes
- Risks and tradeoffs
