# Controls

Controls are not paperwork. Controls are *systems design*.

Controls are the mechanisms that make financial truth repeatable: approvals, segregation of duties, audit trails, and reconciliations.

This section captures practical control architecture:
- Approval chains that match spending authority
- Segregation of duties that works in small teams
- Audit trails that survive staff turnover and growth
- Policy-to-system alignment (so rules are enforced by workflow)

## Outcomes
- Reduced fraud and error surface area
- Faster audit readiness with less anxiety
- Clear accountability: who approved what, when, and why

## Key topics
- Control objectives: completeness, accuracy, authorization, timeliness
- Workflow design: procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, payroll, month-end close
- Exception handling: overrides, emergency approvals, logging
- Access controls: roles, least privilege, periodic reviews
