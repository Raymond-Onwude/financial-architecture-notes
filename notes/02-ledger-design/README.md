# Ledger Design

Ledger design is where finance becomes *queryable truth*.

This section covers how to structure:
- **Chart of Accounts (COA)** for both statutory and management reporting
- **Dimensions / segments** to track reality (program, location, funder, client, project)
- **Subledgers** (AR/AP/Payroll/Inventory) and clean posting logic to the GL
- **Close discipline** so monthly reporting is routine, not heroic

## Outcomes this section targets
- Any manager question is answerable without spreadsheet gymnastics
- Transactions post once, correctly, and remain explainable months later
- Budget vs Actual works across departments, programs, and funders

## Key topics
- COA patterns: minimal, expandable, auditable
- Dimensions: when to segment vs when to use accounts
- Posting rules: what is allowed into the GL and what is not
- Reconciliation map: what must reconcile to what, every month

## Workstream
Daily notes in this folder will build toward a complete “reference architecture” for decision-ready ledgers.
