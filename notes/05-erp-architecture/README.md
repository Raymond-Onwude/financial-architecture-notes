# ERP Architecture

ERP is not software selection. It’s how systems produce governance and speed.

It's system design: data model, workflows, controls, integrations, and operating rhythm.

## What lives here
- ERP design patterns (Odoo and beyond)

This section documents:
- Architecture patterns for ERP deployments
- Multi-entity / multi-program structures
- Integration principles (payments, payroll, banking, CRM, inventory)
- Upgrade-safe customization practices

## Outcomes
- Implementations that ship clarity, not just features
- Configurations that survive growth, audits, and staff changes
- A system that enforces process instead of relying on memory

## Key topics
- Configuration layers: what to configure vs what to customize
- Data model and dimensions: consistency across modules
- Deployment thinking: environments, backups, access, change control
- Odoo patterns (and where alternatives make sense)
