# ERP Architecture

ERP systems should enforce architecture — not replace it.

This section covers:
- ERP structure and configuration patterns
- environment design (dev, test, prod)
- integrations and data boundaries
- deployment considerations

Odoo is discussed where relevant, but principles remain system-agnostic.
