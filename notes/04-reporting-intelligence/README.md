# Reporting Intelligence

Reporting intelligence turns accounting data into decisions.

Decision-ready reporting is the output of good architecture: consistent coding, reconciled drivers, and aligned KPIs.

This section covers:
- Management reporting (KPIs, runway, margin, unit economics)
- Funding reporting (restricted funds, program reporting, compliance)
- Board reporting (signal over noise)
- Data quality checks that prevent “numbers debates”

## Outcomes
- A single source of truth for leaders
- Month-end packages that are consistent and explainable
- Metrics that connect to operational drivers

## Key topics
- KPI design: definition, ownership, cadence, and interpretation
- Reporting packs: what a CFO would ship weekly/monthly/quarterly
- Variance logic: what good variance narratives look like
- Dimensional reporting: slicing without breaking reconciliation
